    ArrayExpression accession data E-MTAB-62 as an ExpressionSet object.
}
\description{
    Re-analysis of human gene expression data generated on the Affymetrix HG_U133A platform. A large, normalized expression dataset containing data from 5372 Affymetrix arrays (along with associated phenotypic information) was downloaded from ArrayExpress accession E-MTAB-62 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-62/). This was then processed using the R package bias 0.0.3 (Eklund and Szallasi, 2008) to reduce the impace of technical bias on the dataset, and converted into an 'ExpressionSet' object. Details of the original dataset can be found at E-MTAB-62 and Lukk, et al. (2010).

\usage{data(E.MTAB.62)}
\value{
    The data is provided as an 'ExpressionSet' object. The phenotypic data provides several curated categories of metadata for each sample, described further in Lukk, et al. (2010).
